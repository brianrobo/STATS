* Brief overview of statistic
  * Define the **population**
  * Discuss method of taking **samples** from this population
  * **Designing studies** that can best answer particular research questions.
  * to identify the scope of inference for a study
    - whether we can make causal versus correlational statement
    - when we can generalize our conclusinos to the population at large
  * learn methods of exploratory data analysis
    - data visualizations
    - summary statistics


* Data Basics
* [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-intro/lecture/Q0zu3/data-basics)

* 3 main concepts
  * observations, variables and data matrices
  * types of variable
  * relationships between variables

* data matrix
  * row : observation(case)
  * column : variable

* types of variables
  * all variables
    - numerical (quantitative)
      + : take on numerical values sensible to add, subtract, take averages, etc. with these values
      - continous
        - : take on any of an infinite number of values within a given range
	- (e.g, height)
      - descrete
        - : take on one of a specific set of numeric values
	- (e.g, number of cars a household own)
    - categorical (qualitative)
      + : take on a limited number of distinct categories
      + : categories can be identified with numbers, but not sensible to do arithmetic operations
